	<h1>Hello! I'm Ashley Ruen.  </h1>
	
<h2>Professional Bio</h2>

<p>I am currently a junior at Michigan State University; expected graduation, December 2013. I am studying Media and Information with a concentration in Interactive and Social Media and a specialization in Digital Humanities. I have thoroughly enjoyed taking course work in web development, interactive design, information architecture and information management. I am enthusiastic to start a career path that utilizes both my interest in technology and my passion for education.</p>
<p>	At MSU, I am a member of Phi Sigma Theta | National Honors Society, National Society of Collegiate Scholars, and Kappa Kappa Gamma. Outside of school, I am the Communications and Social Media Intern at <a href="http://www.jrturnbull.com">JR Turnbull Communications</a>; a full service cause marketing and event production company. I am also a Business Development Intern at <a href="http://www.coursehero.com/about.php">Course Hero Inc.</a>; an e-learning company. </p>

<h2>Panic.com Critique</h2>
<p>
Panic.com is a company that I am slightly familiar with. I have used Transmit previously in CAS204, and found it to be a great product. I do not think their website is a great representation of their products. When I first pull up the main page, I notice that the bottom icons are cut off because of the large size of the graphics. It makes me initially think they only produce three products. Then the other 3 products are made visible upon scrolling. I think this is a definite design flaw in the webpage. The user should not have to scroll to see the whole purpose of the webpage. It is any easy fix though. All they need to do is make the graphics slightly smaller. I do however like the rollover effect. It makes it quick for the user to get more information on product. I also first notice the color scheme. I think that it has too many colors; from the blue and white Panic logo, to the purple and red title font, and then the light grey background. I think it would look a lot more aesthetically pleasing if they stuck to a specific color scheme. Then that leads me to the triangle graphic at the bottom; again with the colors -- I think a website should be designed around a logo. The blue and white logo looks out of place with this triangle graphic. Not only does the graphic lack visual appeal, but it also is a distraction from the information on the page. 
</p><p>
When you click on the graphics to go to each app's page, the design completely changes. I think that the design of the app pages should be incorporated into the main page of the website. It should not feel like I am traveling to a completely different site each time I click on an internal link. I think another huge design flaw on the linked pages is spacing and the size of everything. Both of these make reading confusing and difficult. The images used to explain the text are not helpful because they lack quality; each graphic is very blurry. The user has to click on the image so that it will pop out and then it is clearer. Each page is very inconsistent. While I think the Transmit page is more successful in displaying information that is easily consumed. Then the Prompts page is awful; you can hardly get a feel of what the product does. Then to go back to the main page the graphic is small in the left hand corner. I think the link to the home page should be much more obvious.
</p>
<p>
Overall, I think the website does the bare minimum to market their products to users. I think that it has all of the information there, but needs some definite help in design. Much of the website is just simply not navigationally friendly. The main logo of the blue and white 'P' should be prominent through out the page, not just on the main page. I also think that the colors should flow much better with the main logo.</p>
