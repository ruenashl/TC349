My initial thought when I look at the website is that it is clean and sleek. My eyes are immediately drawn to the large red video. I think that it would be better if my eyes were initially drawn to a heading, so I could get a better idea of what this website is about. I do not like the small logo with his name next to it. I see that his name is in bold to differentiate from the rest of the titles.

When I click over to the Articles tab, I really like the effect when hovering over links. I also like how the tab that is clicked shows a red line above it. I think that the About page has a very good layout. It is edgy, but still maintains a sleek look. 

My favorite part of this webpage is the bottom area above the footer. I almost wish that it was at the top of the page. The layout is very aesthetically pleasing.
