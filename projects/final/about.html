			<p>As I continue working towards my Bachelors of the Arts degree from Michigan State University, I am incredibly excited to begin my journey in the "real world". The past 3 years have flown by and in 6 short months I will be packing up my East Lansing life and moving to New York City (details: TBD). I know that my major is extremely relevant in almost every industry today, but I am most interested in working for an educational technology company. Although education (especially in the United States) is slow to adapt to all of the new technology, the EdTech world is exploding with new advancements in making education more efficient, effective and fun.</p>
			<h4>I want to be apart of revolutionizing the way we learn.</h4>
