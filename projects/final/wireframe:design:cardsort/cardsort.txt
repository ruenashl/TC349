Personal Site Card Sorting
Personal Analysis


My plan for my final project is to create a site that gives me a stronger web presence. I would like to eventually be able it to use to promote myself in the business world. It would contain information about my education, relevant course work and classes I have taken, past experiences in clubs on campus and work experience. I would also include a contact page and links to my LinkedIn and Twitter. I used websort.net again for this card sorting exercise. I went through my personal site and created 4 categories: main menu, home, about, experience. I then began sorting cards based on my information into each category.

Participant Analysis
                
 was a little surprised at my results because I expected to have a higher agreement percentage, but I suppose that is biased because I made my site according to what makes sense to me. It was interesting to see that the participants mostly stumbled when it came to the About category, which I can understand. Most of my cards tended to be very general, so it would make sense for them to be in either category. Other than the About mishap, the other categories were pretty agreeable to my initial placement.
