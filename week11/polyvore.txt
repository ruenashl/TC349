I chose to review m.polyvore.com. I usually only use Polyvore on my laptop, but occasionally I will browse it on my iPhone. Polyvore's mobile site is almost a direct replica of their normal website. The design and layout are not lost in the mobile site. When I first access the site, there is a notification asking if I want to download the Polyvore app from the app store. I have downloaded this on my phone and while using the application I also find that Polyvore flawlessly moves from webpage, to mobile webpage, to application with out losing any of their original design theme and usability.
	The home page is an assortment of top stories. Each story has a picture representation and then a title below the image. It is very simple and clean, but is able to grab the users attention with the image. On the normal website as you scroll down the home page more and more news stories continue to load, but they have a great navigation button on the bottom right, allowing the user to return "back to top". Unfortunately, this button is not implemented in the mobile site. It is helpful that the top navigation is fixed, so as I scroll down I always have to come back too. I think all together Polyvore is a great site, with an incredibly user friendly interface and none of that is lost while switching to the mobile site.
