Wow!, is the first thing I think when the page loads. I love this design. It is simplistic with the perfect color scheme. The colors have a matte look that I think emphasizes the content just enough, while not overpowering the content. The colors are used to make the page more user friendly and they do just that. For example, the show me more button has a bright yellow background that my eyes are immediately drawn too and makes me want to know more. I really like the navigation that sticks as you scroll and I think the overhang of the logo is a great touch. I also like the font they use, it is professional and clean but is not boring.

Once I got past the great design, I'm drawn in further by the content. It is written for the user. I don't ever find myself confused. Everything is simple and to the point. From the first glance, the top banner tells me exactly what HappyCog is and what they can do for me. After scrolling down the page I began to click on the navigation and I realized that it navigates to different locations on the page. The site does not have a lot of content, but because the content that it does have is all the user needs. I think HappyCog's headline say's it all, they design sites that balance beauty, strategy, and utility, and their company website depict's this perfectly.
