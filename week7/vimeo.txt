When I first arrive at Vimeo, I have flash backs of almost every website we have critiqued thus far. Although, when it is done really well I love this layout, I don't think I "love" Vimeo's version. It is a little messy for me. I like simple and put together and this site seems a little chaotic. That being said, I think it is great that you can preview many videos on the first page. It really draws the user in and it does a great job of promoting what the site is all about.

There is a header and footer both have the same eclectic background, which I think is fun, but not my taste. As you scroll, it is broken into sections filled with more videos. The content is very well put together and I find there is some what of a flow to the madness. But at times I am not sure where I should be looking and the clutter takes over. The site map is great! It helps to simplify and categorize all of the content in an extremely user-friendly way. The fact that I need a site map to help me navigate is probably not the best thing when it comes to user interaction. I think the site fits for it's audience though, its just not aesthetically pleasing necessarily in my eyes. Overall, I think it is an incredibly well designed site. I just personally do not "love" the messy feeling I get from it.
