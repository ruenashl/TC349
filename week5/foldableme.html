<h2>Personal Analysis</h2>
<p>I used an online generator called WebSort.net for my Foldable.me card sorting assignment. This seemed to be the easiest and most efficient way to get a variety of participants to participate in my study. My sort was very similar to the architecture of the website. This is probably because I navigated the website perviously to card sorting. So I had a general idea of the websites layout and was influenced by seeing how the website was directly laid out. Although, I did find it slightly difficult to sort becuase there was not large amount of content, I found that the website was organized fairly intuitively. So when I began sorting my cards, I did not differ from the original layout of foldable.me. </p>

<h2>Participant Analysis</h2>
<p>I performed a closed sort, so I initally created 5 categories for the cards to be put 	under: main menu, about, create, blog and contact. I think this was benefital because it gave the people who have never looked at the website before a general framework to understand. Overall my agreement percentages among sorters was consistently over 60%, which I think is a relatively good percentage. And speaks true to the generally well designed framework of foldable.me.</p>
