\f0\fs24 \cf0 	Etsy is a website for buying and selling artsy materials. From first appearance the website seems simple, but to the point. The color scheme is white and grey except for the Etsy button that stands out with an orange gradient background. I really like the way the Etsy button stands out from the rest of the webpage. It is a great brand identifier. The top navigation remains consistent as the user browsers from page to page. This makes it very user friendly. To the left there is navigation for browsing through different categories. The home page also has categories with photos based on the time of year; so right now there are Valentines day categories. It also has different sections to promote a specific persons style or specific persons shop, along with various Etsy blog posts.\
	When I browse to a specific category I think that the set up is very unique. I like the way there is clear navigation at the top to the broken down sub categories, but there are also pictures, varying in size, with a quick peak and whatever might be inside each sub category. I think all together Etsy has a great design and is very user friendly.}
